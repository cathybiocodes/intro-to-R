# This repository has my records of my R workbooks and practice during my time in University.
I am using this as past reference for when I forget certain basic R coding skills that I have learned at the University of South Florida. 
Each file contains one module that I have worked on for every week during the semester I was there.
As I try to rebuild my profile on GitHub, I hope to get more practice in and achieve my career goals in becoming an advanced researcher in medicine and bioinformatics.
